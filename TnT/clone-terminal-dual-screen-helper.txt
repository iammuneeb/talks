Description:    This TnT shows how you can clone the session from one terminal
                to other terminal. This setup is helpful when you don't want
                the audience to see irrelevant commands which you want to test
                in some other terminal. 
================================================================================

Steps:
------
    1. Open a Terminal-1 and execute following command.
        $ mkfifo /tmp/cloneterm
        $ script -f /tmp/cloneterm

    2. Open another Terminal-2 and execute following command.
        $ cat /tmp/cloneterm

        Move this Terminal-2 on next monitor/projector. Now whatever you write 
        in Terminal-1 will be shown on Terminal-2. You can open up another 
        Terminal-3 for testing purpose.

    3. To close the session, type 
        $ exit
        in Terminal-1
